SpectrumViewJS
==============

SpectrumViewJS provides an SVG based component for displaying
the electromagnetic spectrum.

This project evolved out of the project 'EarthFrequencies',
since it was there was enough potential to make this its own
project, such that it could be reused in other projects.

The main repository for this project can be found on GitHub at:
https://github.com/ajmas/SpectrumViewJS

Compatibility
-------------

This project is designed to work with 'modern' browsers, that
support HTML5, SVG and Javascript.

Dependencies
------------

Currently this project depends on the following Javascript
libraries
   - JQuery 2.x
   - SnapSVG

Status
------

This is very much an pre-alpha, so expect API changes and instability,
as the project evolves and feedback tweaks the focus.
